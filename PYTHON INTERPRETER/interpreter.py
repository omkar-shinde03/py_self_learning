python
# its alos been said to be the INTERACTIVE mode of the python interpretor

# USING  pyhton as CALCULATOR

>>>  
# this sign refers that the python interpretor is on its wokr and in interactive mode.

# we can directly give any mathmatic or calculatory operation to interpreter and we can use it as a calculator.
 
# The integer numbers (e.g. 2, 4, 20) have type int, the ones with a fractional part (e.g. 5.0, 1.6) have type float. We will see more about numeric types later in the tutorial.

#  Division (/) always returns a float. To do floor division and get an integer result you can use the // operator; to calculate the remainder you can use %:

# *  for multiplication 
# ** for  power

#    5 ** 2  # 5 squared

#    2 ** 7  # 2 to the power of 7
